                <h2 id="home">Home Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The Home.html page uses semantic HTML tags like header, nav, and section to create a clear structure. Flexbox (display: flex) is used for layout, ensuring responsive alignment of the header, cards, and sections. Key CSS properties include position: fixed to keep the header visible during scrolling, transform: scale() and box-shadow for interactive hover effects on cards, and @keyframes fadeInUp for fade-in animations. The page is designed to be visually engaging and functional, with a focus on user interaction.</p> 
                    
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>Accessibility in Home.html is addressed through alt text for images, ensuring screen readers can describe visual content. Semantic HTML tags (header, nav, main) improve navigation for screen readers. High-contrast text (#ffffff on #000000) ensures readability, and focus states for interactive elements (e.g., buttons, links) aid keyboard navigation.</p>

                <h2 id="table">Table Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The table.html page uses a table element to display marine data, with th and td tags for headers and data cells. CSS properties like border-collapse and text-align ensure a clean, organized layout. The table is simple yet effective, with tooltips (title attribute) providing additional context for icons. The design focuses on clarity and ease of use.</p> 

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>Accessibility in table.html is improved with proper table structure (thead, tbody), allowing screen readers to interpret the data correctly. The title attribute provides tooltips for icons, adding context for users. High-contrast text and clear borders ensure the table is readable and easy to navigate.</p>

                <h2 id="content">Content Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>In Content_St2.html, content is organized into sections (section) for coral reef information, threats, and solutions. Flexbox aligns text and images side by side, while the fade-in animation (@keyframes fadeInUp) adds visual appeal. CSS properties like max-width and border-radius ensure consistent image sizing and styling. The page is designed to be informative and visually cohesive.</p> 

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>In Content_St2.html, accessibility is ensured through alt text for images and semantic HTML tags (section, h5) for clear content structure. High-contrast text and sufficient spacing improve readability, while the fade-in animation does not interfere with screen reader functionality.</p>

                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                    <p>During implementation, one challenge was ensuring consistent responsiveness across devices, particularly with the flexbox layout in Home.html. Initially, the cards and header did not align properly on smaller screens. This was resolved by adjusting CSS properties like flex-wrap and adding media queries. Another challenge was implementing the fade-in animation without causing performance issues. By optimizing the @keyframes and reducing the number of animated elements, the issue was mitigated. These challenges taught me the importance of testing on multiple devices and optimizing animations for performance.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2>
                    <p>The pages comply with Janet regulations by ensuring accessibility and usability. Semantic HTML tags, alt text for images, and high-contrast text meet accessibility standards. The use of valid HTML and CSS, along with proper structuring of content, ensures the pages are easy to navigate and maintain. While the pages are not formally validated, efforts were made to follow best practices for web development, including responsive design and accessibility considerations. Compliance with these regulations ensures the pages are inclusive and functional for all users.</p>
