                            <li><b>&ltlabel&gt : </b>This is so because this means that all of the form fields shall be provided with alternate text. Screen readers can now convert the text for the visually impaired. </li><br>

                    <p>
                        Web development had a plot to tell, and it was not a fairytale, for there were some struggles on the way, which worked towards developing technical skills and problem-solving.” One of the main issues was the user experience was not smooth across different devices. The first step was to make the design more suitable for small screens, because of the missing optimization which in turn affected navigation and legibility. The following were the main accomplishments realized: the use of FlexBox and CSS Grid along with the philosophy of using 'media queries' of responding to lay-out resizing by dynamically changing the UI. On the other hand, accessibility was another challenge, as the website did not contain the necessary alt attributes and ARIA labels for the images and interactive elements, respectively. The correction of these issues resulted in the website being more accessible to the group of people who have various types of disabilities. These difficulties brought accessibility and responsiveness into sharp focus, demonstrating the necessity of integrating these elements from the beginning, otherwise, they will turn into bulky makeovers.
